# SamuraiLoan Protocol - Implementation Guide

## Overview
A simplified lending and borrowing protocol built for educational purposes to understand the core concepts of DeFi lending protocols.

## Core Features (Phase 1)
- Support for ERC20 tokens (collateral and loan assets)
- Fixed interest rate model
- Simple liquidation mechanism
- Single chain deployment (Ethereum testnet)
- Basic risk parameters (fixed LTV ratio)

## Smart Contract Architecture

### Core Contracts
1. **SamuraiLoan.sol**
   - Main contract handling core lending/borrowing logic
   - Manages protocol state and interactions

2. **CollateralManager.sol**
   - Handles collateral deposits
   - Manages collateral withdrawals
   - Tracks collateral balances

3. **LoanManager.sol**
   - Creates new loans
   - Processes loan repayments
   - Handles liquidations
   - Tracks loan status

4. **InterestCalculator.sol**
   - Fixed interest rate calculations
   - Interest accrual logic

### Key Functions to Implement

#### Collateral Management
- `depositCollateral(address token, uint256 amount)`
- `withdrawCollateral(address token, uint256 amount)`
- `getCollateralBalance(address user, address token)`

#### Loan Operations
- `requestLoan(address token, uint256 amount, uint256 collateralAmount)`
- `repayLoan(uint256 loanId, uint256 amount)`
- `liquidatePosition(uint256 loanId)`
- `getLoanStatus(uint256 loanId)`

## Security Considerations
- Implement reentrancy protection
- Use SafeMath for arithmetic operations
- Add access control mechanisms
- Validate all inputs
- Emit events for tracking
- Implement emergency pause functionality

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test each contract in isolation
   - Cover all public functions
   - Test edge cases and error conditions

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test complete lending flow
   - Test liquidation scenarios
   - Test interest calculations
   - Test collateral management

3. **Test Coverage**
   - Aim for 90%+ coverage
   - Focus on critical functions
   - Include edge cases

## Deployment Steps
1. Deploy to Ethereum testnet
2. Verify contracts
3. Test main functionality
4. Deploy frontend interface
5. Document deployment process

## Next Steps
1. Set up development environment
2. Create project structure
3. Implement core contracts
4. Write tests
5. Deploy and test
6. Add frontend interface

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Dynamic interest rates
- Multiple collateral types
- Governance system
- Cross-chain support
- Advanced risk management
